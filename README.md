### Repository Introduction (README Overview)

## EchoEval - Evaluating Residual Echo Suppression in Double-Talk Scenarios

**EchoEval** is an **open-source** toolkit for objectively assessing **Residual Echo Suppression (RES)** performance, especially in **double-talk** conditions.  
This project provides two key evaluation metrics:  

- **DSML (Desired-Speech Maintained Level)** – measures how well the target speech is preserved.  
- **RESL (Residual-Echo Suppression Level)** – quantifies the effectiveness of echo suppression.  

### Key Features:  
✅ **Standardized DSML & RESL** evaluation metrics  
✅ Compatible with **deep learning, traditional signal processing, and hybrid models**  
✅ Applicable to **speech enhancement, speech recognition, and echo cancellation**  
✅ **Open-source, reproducible, and easy to integrate** into **Python-based** workflows  

This repository is designed for **researchers, audio engineers, and developers** looking to enhance speech quality evaluation.
